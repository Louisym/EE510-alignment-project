Find P[A|B] if A ∩ B = ∅,P(A|B) = 0 when A and B are disjoint.,"If A ∩ B = ∅, then A and B are disjoint. Therefore:
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0 / P(B) = 0.

This follows from the definition of conditional probability....","Given: A ∩ B = ∅ (A and B are disjoint events)

Using the definition of conditional probability:
P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Since A and B are disjoint:
P(A ∩ B) = P(∅) = 0

Therefore:
P(A|B) = 0 / P(B)..."
Show that P[A|B] satisfies the axioms of probability,P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) satisfies probability axioms.,"We verify the three axioms:
1) 0 ≤ P(A|B) ≤ 1 since P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(B)
2) P(S|B) = P(S ∩ B) / P(B) = P(B) / P(B) = 1
3) For disjoint events, P(A ∪ C | B) = P(A|B) + P(C|B)...","We must verify that P(·|B) satisfies the three axioms of probability:

Axiom 1: Non-negativity and upper bound
Since A ∩ B ⊆ B, we have P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(B).
Dividing by P(B) > 0: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) ≤ ..."
Let X be a geometric random variable. Find P[N = k | N ≤ m],"For geometric distribution, the conditional probability is p(1-p)^(k-1).","Let N be geometric with parameter p. For k ≤ m:
P(N = k | N ≤ m) = P(N = k) / P(N ≤ m)
= p(1-p)^(k-1) / (1 - (1-p)^m)

For k > m, the probability is 0....","Problem: Find P[N = k | N ≤ m] for geometric random variable N.

Solution:
Let N ~ Geometric(p), so P(N = n) = p(1-p)^(n-1) for n ≥ 1.

First, compute P(N ≤ m):
P(N ≤ m) = Σ(n=1 to m) p(1-p)^(n-1)
= p..."
